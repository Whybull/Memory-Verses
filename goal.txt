Using "BrainScape" I had the idea that I could put my own bible verses in it and memorize using it. Of course, this led to me needing to catagorizing my verses so an organized way to catagorize/organize memory verses is the goal.

I would like to come up with 100 top verses. At least that is my starting goal.

This leads me to needing to needing to create a file with the foundational doctrine concepts and shape a set of verses around that.
